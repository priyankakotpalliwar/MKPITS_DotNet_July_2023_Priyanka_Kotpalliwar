    <p class="lead">This is how a paragraph stands out in Bootstrap.</p>
    <h1 class="lead">Bootstrap's global default font-size is 1rem (typically 16px), with a line-height of 1.5 (typically 24px), which is applied to the body element as well as all the paragraphs i.e. the p elements. In addition to that margin-bottom of 1rem is also applied to all the paragraphs.</h1>
